       "1. `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` is a set comprehension that:\n",
       "   - Iterates through each `book` in the `books` list\n",
       "   - Uses `book.get(\"author\")` to safely get the \"author\" field (returns None if key doesn't exist)\n",
       "   - Only includes authors that are truthy (not None, empty string, etc.) due to the `if` condition\n",
       "   - Creates a set (which automatically deduplicates authors)\n",
       "\n",
       "2. `yield from` then takes this set of unique authors and yields each one individually from the generator.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **`yield from`**: This syntax was introduced in Python 3.3 as part of PEP 405 (Yield From Expression). It allows you to yield values from another iterable or generator, which is more memory-efficient than creating a new list and returning it explicitly.\n",

      "\n",
      "    - `for book in books`: Iterates through each item (`book`) in the 'books' iterable.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - `if book.get(\"author\")`: Applies a condition to only include items where `'author'` key exists and has a non-empty value.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `yield from {expression}`: When used with dictionary comprehension generators, it yields values in an efficient manner rather than returning them as a whole list (which would consume significant memory when dealing with large datasets).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, when you put these two together, the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Iterates over each book.\n",
      "2. Checks if 'author' key exists and is non-empty for each book.\n",
      "3. Yields (not returns) only the value of the `'author'` key that passes the above check.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be used in a situation where you're collecting information about books from multiple sources, or if each source could send data one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example to illustrate its usage:\n",
